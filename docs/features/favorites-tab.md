### User Value & Business Goals

- **User Retention**: Provides users with personalized content and quick access to items they care about
- **Engagement**: Encourages users to interact with the app by saving items they want to track
- **User Experience**: Reduces friction in finding and accessing frequently viewed content
- **Data Insights**: Provides valuable user preference data for future feature development

### User Personas & Goals

- **Casual Fan**: Wants quick access to their favorite national teams and players
- **Serious Supporter**: Tracks multiple leagues, teams, and players across competitions
- **International Fan**: Follows specific countries and their competitions

### User Flows

1. **Adding Favorites**: User navigates to any detail screen → taps favorite button → item appears in Favorites tab
2. **Viewing Favorites**: User taps Favorites tab → sees categorized tabs → selects category → views favorite items
3. **Managing Favorites**: User can remove items from favorites directly in the Favorites tab

### MVP Scope & Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Third tab in bottom navigation labeled "Favorites"
- [ ] Four category tabs: Countries, Competitions, Teams, Players
- [ ] Display list of favorite items in each category
- [ ] Empty state when no favorites exist in a category
- [ ] Navigation to detail screens from favorite items
- [ ] Remove favorite functionality within the tab

### Success Metrics

- User engagement with Favorites tab
- Number of items favorited per user
- Time spent in Favorites tab
- User retention improvement

### Technical Architecture

#### Navigation Structure

```typescript
// Updated navigation types
export type RootTabParamList = {
  Scores: undefined;
  Favorites: undefined; // New tab
  Settings: undefined;
};

export type FavoritesStackParamList = {
  FavoritesHome: undefined;
  // Reuse existing detail screens for navigation
  CountryDetail: { item: Country };
  LeagueDetail: { item: LeagueItem };
  CupDetail: { item: LeagueItem };
  MatchDetail: { item: Fixture };
  PlayerDetail: { item: PlayerProfile };
};
```

#### Component Hierarchy

```
FavoritesTabNavigator
├── FavoritesHomeScreen
│   ├── CategoryTabs (Countries, Competitions, Teams, Players)
│   ├── FavoritesList (renders based on selected category)
│   │   ├── CountryCard (for Countries tab)
│   │   ├── LeagueCard (for Competitions tab)
│   │   ├── TeamCard (for Teams tab)
│   │   └── PlayerCard (for Players tab)
│   └── EmptyState (when no favorites in category)
```

#### Data Flow

1. **FavoritesContext** manages global favorites state
2. **Storage Service** persists favorites to AsyncStorage
3. **Category-specific hooks** filter favorites by type
4. **UI Components** render filtered favorites with navigation

#### State Management

```typescript
// Enhanced FavoritesContext
interface FavoritesContextType {
  // Existing
  favorites: Country[];
  isFavorite: (countryCode: string) => boolean;
  toggleFavorite: (country: Country) => Promise<void>;

  // New for multiple types
  favoriteCountries: Country[];
  favoriteCompetitions: LeagueItem[];
  favoriteTeams: Team[];
  favoritePlayers: PlayerProfile[];

  // Generic methods
  addFavoriteItem: (item: FavoriteItem, type: FavoriteType) => Promise<void>;
  removeFavoriteItem: (itemId: string, type: FavoriteType) => Promise<void>;
  isItemFavorite: (itemId: string, type: FavoriteType) => boolean;
}
```

#### Storage Strategy

- **Unified Storage**: Single favorites storage with type discrimination
- **Type Safety**: Generic storage functions with proper typing
- **Performance**: Efficient filtering and caching of favorites by category

### Technical Considerations

- **Reusability**: Leverage existing card components (CountryCard, LeagueCard, etc.)
- **Performance**: Implement virtual scrolling for large favorite lists
- **Offline Support**: Favorites persist locally and sync when online
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage for all favorite types

## 🧪 Quality Engineer (QE)

### Testing Strategy

#### Unit Tests

- **FavoritesContext**: State management, CRUD operations, error handling
- **Storage Service**: AsyncStorage operations, data persistence, error recovery
- **Category Filtering**: Correct categorization of different item types
- **Navigation**: Proper routing from favorites to detail screens

#### Integration Tests

- **Tab Navigation**: Smooth transitions between bottom tabs
- **Category Switching**: Proper content updates when switching tabs
- **Data Persistence**: Favorites remain after app restart
- **Cross-Navigation**: Adding/removing favorites from different screens

#### UI/UX Tests

- **Empty States**: Proper messaging when no favorites exist
- **Loading States**: Smooth transitions during data fetching
- **Accessibility**: Screen reader support, proper contrast ratios
- **Responsiveness**: Works across different device sizes

### Quality Risks & Mitigation

#### High Risk Areas

1. **Data Consistency**: Favorites getting out of sync between screens

   - **Mitigation**: Single source of truth in FavoritesContext
   - **Testing**: Comprehensive state synchronization tests

2. **Performance**: Large favorite lists causing lag

   - **Mitigation**: Implement virtual scrolling, pagination
   - **Testing**: Performance testing with 100+ favorites

3. **Storage Corruption**: AsyncStorage failures corrupting favorites
   - **Mitigation**: Data validation, backup/restore mechanisms
   - **Testing**: Storage failure simulation, recovery testing

#### Edge Cases

- **Network Failures**: App behavior when offline
- **Storage Limits**: Handling AsyncStorage quota exceeded
- **Invalid Data**: Corrupted favorite items
- **Memory Pressure**: Large favorite lists on low-end devices

### Validation Strategy

- **Automated Testing**: Jest unit tests, React Native Testing Library
- **Manual Testing**: Cross-device testing, different user scenarios
- **Performance Testing**: Memory usage, render performance
- **Accessibility Testing**: Screen reader compatibility, keyboard navigation
